Message to [@Grimler91](https://github.com/Grimler91):  I have stepped on the ancient cobblestones in the capital, north of Stockholm. You enticed me to contribute. Then you with others deleted my hard effort, my work numerous times, before I became aware of your destructive actions towards Termux development. 

Later you banned the [SDRausty GitHub account](https://github.com/SDRausty) from Termux.  You and your team are keeping Termux away from Wikipedia, and guess what, I have a firm idea as to why. You want my latex academic literature, and my smartphone bitcoins Swedish liaison, don't you?  My academic literature is not to be stolen/deleted by you and your Termuxed deb packages!

Message to [@fornwall](https://github.com/fornwall):  DITTO. Do you like being the stooge? Too lazy to merge pull requests? Or is it, no ones rooted, and I cannot get the bitcoins and bounce a Tesla autodrive?

Message to [@Neo-Oli](https://github.com/Neo-Oli):  DITTO without Sweden encouraging me to root my stuff, just you and your team encouraging me to root away my Android citadel from Switzerland!

Message to [@xeffyr](https://github.com/xeffyr):  DITTO without Sweden encouraging me to root my stuff, just you and your group encouraging me to root away my Android castle and to delete my open source GitHub contributions from the Ukraine!

Did you want to root my device to get to my BITCOINS?  To bounce my Tesla autodrive? To read my latexed literature? You know, latex is elastic. Read my work through your Termuxed latex *.deb files? I think not Grimler91. Neo-Oli our Termux Swiss liaison can you please confirm? Or are you and your team camping far away from us in the Alpine Mountains with other people's bitcoins?

You didn't like the timings, did you? I did not like them at all. Why is Termux slower? Degustamos rooted bitcoins?

Listen to [alphaV.webm](https://github.com/sdrausty/sdrausty.github.io/blob/master/audio/alphaV.webm?raw=true) and possibly you shall comprehend. Possibly.

`while true ; do play-audio alphaV.webm ; sleep ${RANDOM::2} ; done`

As you may well know, I have been using Termux software since it arrived. After years of using (coof coof) your open source software (does it compile?) I have a firm opinion about you. If it doesn't compile, what are you feeding me? Why are you wasting my time? To get my autodrive, my bitcoins? Why doesn't it compile from the source code that you publish?
